4 List any 3 ways which help in improving the accessibility of HTML


Use Semantic Markup:

Employ semantic elements like <header>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> to structure your content logically.
This allows screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the hierarchy and meaning of your content, 
making it easier for users to navigate and find information.


Provide Descriptive Text Alternatives:

Use descriptive alt text for images to convey their meaning to users who rely on screen readers or have low vision.
Provide transcripts for audio content and captions for videos to make them accessible to users with hearing impairments.
Clearly label form fields and buttons with descriptive text to help users understand their purpose.


Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:

Design your website to be fully keyboard-navigable. This allows users who cannot use a mouse or touchpad to navigate and interact with all parts of your website.
Use focus states and keyboard shortcuts to guide users through your website.
Avoid using features that rely solely on JavaScript or other assistive technologies that may not be available to all users.
